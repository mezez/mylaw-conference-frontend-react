A lot of developers build amazing tools everyday but somehow struggle to come up with a portfolio site for themselves. I happen to be the biggest culprit of this.

This tool is a generic one that should lift the burden of having to build portfolio sites for for yourself.

To set up, all you have to do is modify the config.js file in the src folder to suit your profile and add your profle image or avatar in the public/images folder.

The goal here is to eliminate any backend or serverside programming whatsoever.

This is a work in progress.

Project is only just starting and open to contributions.

Ideally, app is meant to intregrate UI elements from https://github.com/contiamo/operational-ui, a great tool for making usage of UI elemets really easy and amazing.
